# 🎮 How to create & play 2 accounts on one device

Follow these simple steps to make a new character — no more switching between accounts!

---

## 📱 Step 1: Get a Second Email
You’ll need a **different email address** from the one you use for your main game account.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Download a Clone App
Go to the **Google Play Store** and download one of these:
- **Parallel Space**
- **Parallel App** *(worked free and no subscription needed!)*

These apps let you run a second copy of the game on one phone.

---

## 🧟 Step 3: Launch the Game from the Clone App
1. Open the **Parallel App**.
2. Add **Last Z** (the game).
3. Start the game — it will begin from scratch.
4. Play until you reach the part when **your profile appears**.
